Every single block in Minecraft. Every single one.

This is somehow not on the internet from what I could find, so here's a spreadsheet containing every single block in the latest full version of Minecraft Java Edition as of the time of the repository's latest release. Not only is this up-to-date, but it also contains several details that the other lists I found don't have, such as:

- Technical variants of blocks (moving piston, lit/wall torches, etc.)
- All available blockstates, if applicable
- Specific version categorization, down to the snapshot

This spreadsheet was made in LibreOffice, so it will display the best using that program. However, a PDF is also included for those who don't want to worry about cross-program compatibility.

All suggestions and corrections are welcome.
